# Electrical-Faults-Detection-and-Classification-using-Machine-Learning
This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to classify various electrical fault types in a transmission line. The model utilizes voltage and current measurements as inputs to identify and categorize faults such as open-circuit faults, single-line-to-ground faults, line-to-line faults, and three-phase faults.
